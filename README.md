# Adversarial Threat Modelling — A Practical Approach to Purple Teaming in the Enterprise

More and more organisations are beginning to realise the value of Mitre ATT&CK. But how can you bring your teams together to help nurture, develop and deploy a framework which consistently yields results?

This presentation details the approach developed by the Threat Intelligence team of a global bank, and how it worked together with defensive and offensive teams to deliver a compelling solution to uplift the organisations' security posture; one adversary TTP at a time.

The corresponding workshop is designed to provide practical guidance to practitioners that they can adapt for their organisations. Key learning objectives will include transforming Purple Team initiatives to be intelligence-led, and developing and deploying a Threat Library.

This README is designed to support the above workshop which took place on Friday 11th September 2020 as part of [x33fcon](https://www.x33fcon.com/). The presentation and README were subsequently updated in November 2021 to incorporate recent changes to VECTR.

## System Requirements
Please ensure you have installed [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) with the [Extension Pack](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), followed by a virtual machine running x64 [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases). Ideally, the machine should be configured with at least 4GB of RAM with multi-core support.


## Installing VECTR
Detailed installation instructions are available on the [VECTR Documentation](https://docs.vectr.io) site. The code below is provided for convenience to help support the workshop, and is correct for version 8.1.4 of the Community Edition.


### Installing Dependencies
```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"

sudo apt update

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose unzip

sudo apt upgrade

sudo systemctl enable docker
```

On a minimal install of Ubuntu, you may need to install cURL `sudo apt install curl`.


### Installing VECTR
To minimise issues during the workshop, please continue with default configuration options when installing VECTR. In production environments, configuring additional options within the `.env` file is strongly recommended.

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/vectr
cd /opt/vectr

sudo wget https://github.com/SecurityRiskAdvisors/VECTR/releases/download/ce-8.1.4/sra-vectr-runtime-8.1.4-ce.zip -P /opt/vectr
sudo unzip sra-vectr-runtime-8.1.4-ce.zip

sudo docker-compose -p sravectr up -d
```

### Updating the Hosts File
For a default install, add `sravectr.internal` to your hosts file as follows:

```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost   sravectr.internal
```

## Using VECTR
### Launching VECTR
Use the helper scripts [`start_vectr.sh`](./start_vectr.sh) and [`shutdown_vectr.sh`](./shutdown_vectr.sh) within this repo (be sure to `chmod +x`), or run the following directly from your home folder. The very first launch will take a few minutes as VECTR initialises, so please be patient.

```
cd /opt/vectr
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

Struggling to launch VECTR? Run `sudo docker ps`, `sudo docker stop {containerID}` (or `sudo docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)`) and `sudo docker system prune` and try again.


### Logging into VECTR
You should be able to access VECTR at https://sravectr.internal:8081/. The default username is `admin` and the password is `11_ThisIsTheFirstPassword_11`.


### Safely Shutting Down VECTR
```
cd /opt/vectr
sudo docker-compose down
```
